__gitup__ (the _git-repo-updater_)

gitup is a tool designed to update a large number of git repositories at once.
It is smart enough to handle multiple remotes, branches, dirty working
directories, and more, hopefully providing a great way to get everything
up-to-date for short periods of internet access between long periods of none.

# Requirements
gitup should work on OS X, Linux, and Windows. You should have the latest
version of git and either Python 2.7 or Python 3 installed with the [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) extension (if it's missing, check for `pip install setuptools`).

# Installation

With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

    brew install gitup

## From source

First:

    git clone git://github.com/earwig/git-repo-updater.git
    cd git-repo-updater

Then, to install for everyone:

    sudo python setup.py install

...or for just yourself (make sure you have `~/.local/bin` in your PATH):

    python setup.py install --user

Finally, simply delete the `git-repo-updater` directory, and you're done!

__Note:__ If you are using Windows, you may wish to add a macro so you can
invoke gitup in any directory. Note that `C:\python27\` refers to the
directory where Python is installed:

    DOSKEY gitup=c:\python27\python.exe c:\python27\Scripts\gitup $*

# Usage

There are two ways to update repos: you can pass them as command arguments,
or save them as "bookmarks".

For example:

    gitup ~/repos/foo ~/repos/bar ~/repos/baz

will automatically pull to the `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` git repositories.
Additionally, you can just type:

    gitup ~/repos

to automatically update all git repositories in that directory.

To add a bookmark (or bookmarks), either of these will work:

    gitup --add ~/repos/foo ~/repos/bar ~/repos/baz
    gitup --add ~/repos

Then, to update all of your bookmarks, just run gitup without args:

    gitup

Delete a bookmark:

    gitup --delete ~/repos

View your current bookmarks:

    gitup --list

You can mix and match bookmarks and command arguments:

    gitup --add ~/repos/foo ~/repos/bar
    gitup ~/repos/baz            # update 'baz' only
    gitup                        # update 'foo' and 'bar' only
    gitup ~/repos/baz --update   # update all three!

Update all git repositories in your current directory:

    gitup .

By default, gitup will fetch all remotes in a repository. Pass `--current-only`
(or `-c`) to make it fetch _only_ the remote tracked by the current branch.

Also by default, gitup will try to fast-forward all branches that have
upstreams configured. It will always skip branches where this is not possible
(e.g. dirty working directory or a merge/rebase is required). Pass
`--fetch-only` (or `-f`) to only fetch remotes.

After fetching, gitup will _keep_ remote-tracking branches that no longer exist
upstream. Pass `--prune` (or `-p`) to delete them, or set `fetch.prune` or
`remote.<name>.prune` in git config to do this by default.

For a full list of all command arguments and abbreviations:

    gitup --help

Finally, all paths can be either absolute (e.g. `/path/to/repo`) or relative
(e.g. `../my/repo`).
