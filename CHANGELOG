v0.5.2 (released June 9, 2025):

- Support Python 3.13+.
- Drop support for EOL Python versions (3.7 and below).
- Switch to uv for project management.

v0.5.1 (released September 20, 2019):

- Support simple comments in the bookmarks file. (#51)
- Add an integrated pytest testing suite, runnable with `--selftest`.
- Refactor internals, remove deprecated options, and drop support for
  end-of-life Python versions.

v0.5 (released August 28, 2018):

- Added a `--depth` flag to control recursion depth when searching for
  repositories inside of subdirectories. For example:
  - `--depth 0` will never recurse into subdirectories; the provided paths must
    be repositories by themselves.
  - `--depth 1` will descend one level to look for repositories. This is the
    old behavior.
  - `--depth 3` will look three levels deep. This is the new default.
  - `--depth -1` will recurse indefinitely. This is not recommended.
- Allow gitup to be run directly as a Python module (python -m gitup).
- Fixed an error when updating branches if the upstream is completely unrelated
  from the local branch (no common ancestor).
- Fixed error message when fetching from a remote fails.

v0.4.1 (released December 13, 2017):

- Bump dependencies to deal with newer versions of Git.

v0.4 (released January 17, 2017):

- Added a `--prune` flag to delete remote-tracking branches that no longer
  exist on their remote after fetching.
- Added a `--bookmark-file` flag to support multiple bookmark config files.
- Added a `--cleanup` flag to remove old bookmarks that don't exist.
- Added an `--exec` flag to run a shell command on all of your repos.
- Added support for shell glob patterns and tilde expansion in bookmark files.
- Cleaned up the bookmark file format, fixing a related Windows bug. The script
  will automatically migrate to the new one.
- Fixed a bug related to Python 3 compatibility.
- Fixed Unicode support.

v0.3 (released June 7, 2015):

- Added support for Python 3.
- Fixed behavior on bare repositories.
- Made branch updating code safer in general: only fast-forwardable branches
  tracking upstreams are updated. This deprecates `--merge` and `--rebase`.
- Added `--fetch-only` to disable branch updating entirely, if desired.
- Fixed trying to fetch remotes without configured refspecs.
- Miscellaneous fixes and tweaks.
